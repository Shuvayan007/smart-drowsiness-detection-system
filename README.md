# smart-drowsiness-detection-system
Now a days, with the augment of urbanization; the number of cars, taxis, buses, tracks etc. have increased to a huge extent. As a result, number of accidents increased to a large amount due to drowsiness or lack of concentration &amp; moreover huge amounts of accidents occurs on highways due to sudden sleep of drivers due to long drive for hours. In this scenario, this project aims at designing a smart sleep detection system to alert the driver and make him awake by buzzing an alarm within fraction of second after detecting the sleep.                                                                       One camera will be installed to continuously monitor the driver’s face after the engine starts. If drowsiness is detected from the driver’s face, the system will generate a signal. Finally, a buzzer will alert all the passengers including the driver and an accident will be prevented before it occurs.
